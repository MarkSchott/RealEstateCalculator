In this folder there contains multiple scripts to calculate various values relating to a real estate investment. 

ROOTRealEstateCalculator.C is one that prompts you for the necessary values and needs to be run on ROOT

RealEstateCalculator_1_00.cpp is one that prompts and is the earliest version. 

root -l
.x ROOTRealEstateCalculator.C
ROOTRealEstateCalculator()

RealEstateCalculator_1_01.cpp is an early version that reads in values from input.txt and writes them to MortgageValues.txt. It shouldn't be used. 

RealEstateCalculator_1_02.cpp just puts all the values into a class and uses pointers to access.

RealEstateCalculator_1_03.cpp puts the class and functions into Values.h and runs everything from the source file.
