# RealEstateCalculator
This is a simple text based tool to calculate potentially interesting values pertaining to a real estate investment. 
It has minimal functionality. You can provide a text file of key value pairs to be read in but if none is provided on the command line then by default it looks for "input.txt". 

Compilation:

simply run the command

$ make

Usage:

$ ./main.x (optional custom input file)
